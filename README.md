  # E-Commerce Back-End

  ## Description
   In this app I was challenged to code the back end for an e-commerce database consisting of categories, products, tags, and product tags. This app uses the sequelize ORM to interact with SQL and perform CRUD actions on the database.
   
   In completing this challenge, I developed addition skills in the following areas:
   - Interacting with a mysql database using the sequelize ORM
   - Utilizing express routes to serve API requests
   - Incorporating dotenv to safely store environment variables
   - Incorporating async await to handle asyncronous operations
